# MovieSentiments-LR

MovieSentiments-LR is a project designed to analyze IMDB movie reviews using a Logisitic Regression model built from scratch. This project was created with the aim of further understanding the basics of a simple neural network, including loss computation, backward propagation, and updating weights. These steps are done autmoatically by machine learning libraries such PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow. The model has achieved an accuracy score of [insert score here] and generalizes relatively well. To use the model, use the Streamlit app to make predictions. 

The Streamlit app also provides some figures generated during training with different learning rates and epochs. The batch size remained constant at 32, as it was determined to be the best batch size when training the model in regards to the learning rate.

The dataset used to train the model can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews?resource=download&select=reviews.csv
